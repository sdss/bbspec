This describes the hack to include the bbspec extraction code
in the idlspec2d pipeline.  At the top-level, this is trigged
in the pipeline with "SPREDUCE2D,/BBSPEC".

SPREDUCE
   Generate sdProc files for all of the arc frames.
   Spawn bbspec for PSF generation from each arc frame (line 207).

EXTRACT_OBJECT
   No code changes except to call BBSPEC_EXTRACT to replace the
   extracted fluxes and errors (line 303).

BBSPEC_EXTRACT
   New proc to call bbspec extraction looping over sub-images.
